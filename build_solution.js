The solution to this type of build error often involves a multi-pronged approach. There is no single fix. 

1. **Clean the project:** `expo prebuild --clean` will often clear up transient errors. 
2. **Check dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies listed in your `package.json` are valid and compatible.  Missing or conflicting versions are frequent causes.  Review your package.json and look for red flags.   Update packages using `expo install <package_name>`.  Additionally, run `expo update` to ensure Expo is up to date.
3. **Examine the Android build files:** Look at `android/app/build.gradle` and other Android-specific files for errors in configurations. These files can be intricate, so carefully review them for any misconfigurations. 
4. **Verify your Android setup:** Make sure you've installed the necessary Android SDKs, updated Android Studio, and configured your environment correctly.  Issues like incorrect ANDROID_HOME settings can lead to seemingly random build errors.
5. **Examine the log carefully:** Look at the entire error messageâ€”it may point to the correct source of the problem. The error messages in Expo builds can sometimes hide the true source within a cascade of errors.   
6. **Try a fresh build:** If possible, create a fresh Expo project to test your code. Isolate the issue to determine if the error occurs in the base project or within your custom code.  This helps in ruling out more complex project-specific configurations.
