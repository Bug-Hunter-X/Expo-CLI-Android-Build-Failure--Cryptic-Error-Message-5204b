# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Cryptic Error Message

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, bug encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The build process inexplicably fails with a vague error message, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause.  The issue frequently stems from missing dependencies or incorrect configurations within the project or the Expo environment.

This repository provides both a sample project exhibiting the error (build_error.js) and a solution (build_solution.js).  The goal is to illustrate the error and provide a troubleshooting guide.

## Reproducing the Error

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Attempt to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the cryptic error message.

## Solution

The solution may involve several steps, depending on the specific cause of the error. The solution file (build_solution.js) offers a possible approach. Common fixes include:

* **Checking and updating dependencies:** Verify your `package.json` file contains all necessary dependencies and their versions are compatible with Expo and Android. Use `expo install <package>` to add or update packages.
* **Cleaning the build cache:**  Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the build cache and force a fresh build.
* **Inspecting build logs:** Look carefully at the full error output for clues.  The most important detail will often be hidden within the verbose error message provided by the Android build system.
* **Correcting Gradle configurations:** In some instances, configurations in `android/app/build.gradle` might need adjustments, depending on your dependencies or app requirements. 
* **Investigate Android environment:** Ensure your Android environment is correctly set up with the necessary SDKs, tools, and build configurations.
